## Welcome to my first Blog using FS-Framework and Django

### The idea of ![This is an image](/static/img/minilogga.png) is to create a common platform for crafters of all ages, where they can read articles about all sorts of crafting and to take part of step-by-step tutorials.
I do reccomend to check this README.md file out and I hope you are able to see the same possibilities I see.
the live version of ![This is an image](/static/img/minilogga.png) can be found [here](https://volausson-myblogg.herokuapp.com/).

  * On clicking the 'registration' link ![This is an image](/static/img/signup2.png)
If all fields apart the optional one are not properly filled out a warning will be triggered urging user to fill in the field.  

  * Once registered the 'sign in' link lets you sign in as a user and also gives the opportunity to leave comments and like post on the blog

   If users tries to sign in without registering first they will get message ![This is an image](/static/img/signinerr.png)
